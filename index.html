						EARLY LIFE
						On February 16, 1990,Abel Makkonen Tesfaye in Scarborough, Ontario. He grew up an only child of two Ethiopian migrants,Makkonen and Samra Tesfaye. In his childhood his mother would work mulitple jobs at once to support her family while at the same time having night school. His father is said to have abandoned the family. This led to his grandmother to take care of Abel. After frequent meetings with his grandmother he became fluent in Amharic with Semitic language being his first language. Both him and his grandma listened to Ethiopian music which influenced the music Abel outputs.
						<br><br>
						Abel started using drugs like Marijuana at age 11 and later on moved to harder drugs. Abel describes his teenage years as "KIDS without the AIDS", later on he would start shoplifting with his friend and began using even more drugs. He went to West Hill Collegiate Institue & Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute and did not graduate from any of these schools. His stage name was inspried by his high school dropout status. Thinking of the name "The Weeknd" after he "left one weekend and never came home". Although a producer named Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea.
